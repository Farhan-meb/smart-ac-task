Project Details Name: Programme: Student ID: Project Title: Problem you are seeking to address: Aim and scope: Project objectives: Expected project outcomes: Md Abdul Hafiz MSc Information Technology 24055140 Web-Based Smart Academic Task Planner Masters students across various disciplines often face challenges in managing academic tasks due to complex schedules, diverse coursework, and demanding research requirements. Ineffective task organization can lead to missed deadlines, increased stress, and reduced academic performance. Existing tools like Todoist or Google Calendar lack tailored features for academic contexts, such as integration with course schedules or research project milestones. The proposed web-based Academic Task Planner aims to address these issues by providing a centralized, user-friendly platform for Masters students to manage tasks, deadlines, and academic resources efficiently. Aim: To develop a web application that enables Masters students to manage academic tasks effectively through an intuitive, responsive interface with features for task creation, prioritization, and reminders. Scope: The project involves creating a web-based application using modern web technologies, including HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript, React.js, Node.js, and MongoDB. It will include task prioritization, deadline reminders, and resource management, leveraging open-source tools and APIs for calendar integration. The application will prioritize accessibility and cross-device compatibility, targeting Masters students in various fields. Performance will be evaluated through usability testing and feedback from student users. • Develop a web application for creating, editing, and deleting academic tasks. • Implement a task prioritization system based on deadlines and importance. • Integrate a reminder system for upcoming deadlines and events. • Ensure accessibility and compatibility across devices and browsers. • Use a database to store user data securely. • Create an intuitive user interface with data visualization (e.g., task timelines). • Evaluate usability through student feedback and testing. The project will deliver a web-based Academic Task Planner with: • A responsive interface accessible on desktops, tablets, and smartphones. • Features for task management, prioritization, and reminders, integrated with academic schedules. • Data visualization through graphs or calendars for task trends. • A System Usability Scale (SUS) score of 80+ from user testing. • Scalability for future enhancements, such as AI-driven task suggestions. • Robust error handling for connectivity issues and invalid inputs. The application will enhance Masters students time management, reduce stress, and improve academic productivity Brief review of relevant literature: Effective task management is critical for academic success, yet Masters students often struggle with procrastination and disorganized schedules [1]. Digital tools can mitigate these issues by providing structured task management [2]. However, general-purpose applications lack academic-specific features [3]. User-centered design, guided by Nielsens usability heuristics, ensures intuitive interfaces [4]. Accessibility, as per WCAG 2.1, is essential for inclusivity [5]. React.js supports efficient frontend development with reusable components [6], while Node.js and MongoDB enable scalable backend solutions [7]. Secure authentication via JWT protects user data [8]. Agile methodologies facilitate iterative development and user feedback integration [9]. Finally, studies emphasize the importance of transparent data handling in educational tools to build user trust [10]. 1. Steel, P. (2007). The nature of procrastination.

User testing will involve collecting feedback from Masters students. Participants will be informed of the studys purpose, and consent will be obtained. Data will be anonymized, stored securely per GDPR regulations, and deleted after evaluation. Ethical approval will be sought from the universitys ethics committee, and consultation with the project advisor will ensure compliance with ethical protocols. Hafiz
